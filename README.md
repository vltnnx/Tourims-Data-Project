The aim of this project is to generate a tool to assist its users to determine their next travel destination. At its current stage the project offers the possibility for the users to determine their travel destination based on their desired weather conditions worldwide.

## Project steps
1. Data collection: From online sources, weather data from Meteostat library
2. Data pipeline: Python scripts to clean and structure the data
3. Postgres data warehouse/database: Python scripts to connect to a database and create SQL tables
4. Visualisation: A dashboard in Tableau visualising a temperature map with relevant filters and supporting graphs to investigate deeper
